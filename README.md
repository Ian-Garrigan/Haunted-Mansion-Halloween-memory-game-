# Battleships



------------
Battleships is my first Python terminal game running on Heroku. I studied the classic game endlessly to figure out and target the functions and features neccessary for a simple player vs computer game like this. The ship placements are randomly assigned and a set number of turns are given depending on the board size. 

------------

## Scope 

A very simple and retro type game in the terminal window. A visual 2D grid and story telling to bring it to life. Adding only minimal font colors to make things pop. 

### Existing Features
 
 - A big welcome message with the game title and short introduction to the typical game mode and a chance to create your own custom board size. 

 - User keyboard input instructions for creating their chosen size.

 -Fun snappy dialogue to keep the friendliness and mood alive. 

 - Select a row and column number to deploy a direct hit on that coordinate.

 - The terminal displays a 'O' for a direct hit or a 'X' for a miss. 

 - A counter for how many shots remaining you have. 

 - A 2d view of the board and possible target areas represented by the '-' dash. 

 - Game over message with a chance to request a new game or exit the terminal. 

 -Color coded miss hits in Red for clearer contrast and precision.

 #Feature left i would like to implement

 - The chance for the player to pick the ship size (2, 3 or 4 blocks across)

 - Allow the player to pick their own battleship defensive locations within the board. 

 - If the game is over reveal where the enemy ships were located.

 - Player name input to allow the game to interact on a character level and leave unique messages addressed to you. 

 - Use of an API to store player scores and recent matches in a database. 

 - A green restart button for navigation and ease of use.
